# About

A fork of the Halflife-Update source code made for my tastes [Read the original sourcecode Readme as of 25/08/2025 if you need to know how to compile](https://github.com/twhl-community/halflife-updated/blob/master/README.md).

# Purpose

A small fork i did specifically to add small set of features i wanted when mapping for half-life

# Features
-Item_suit now has second flag that allows it to skip the logon sequence altogether, it will now hand you a bell sound.
-Func_Healthcharge and Func_Recharge can now trigger a function if it runs out of juice.
